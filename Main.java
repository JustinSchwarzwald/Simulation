 * Description: Program simulates a race by creating 3 arrays, one for the racers(8),
 *              the second for the track(composed of individual terrain types each having a randomized length),
 *              lastly an array that holds the info of which terrain the each racer is on(parallel to the racer array).
 *              Depending on the speeds of the racers and the modifiers of each terrain, the race is simulated, 
 *              racers are sorted in order of first place to last. Once a racer crosses the finish line a winner
 *              is returned. If more than one crossed the finish line then a random racer is selected as the winner.(Extra credit)
